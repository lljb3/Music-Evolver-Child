# Music-Evolver-Child
Kake Multimedia and ProdHMD's WordPress small theme for musicians. The child theme!

## Use this child theme to edit and override any files you wish to change!
Example: If you want to change the header file, create a directory "/parts/shared/" and copy the "header.php" file from the parent theme to this new directory. Once that's done, all you have to do is make any edits and voila! The original parent theme won't be broken.

Also on this child theme, you have the ability to add fonts and a list of fonts. Just open the "style.css" file and "functions.php" file and follow the directions on each with the name of your custom font!
